FACIL, a QuÃ©bec non-profit promoting free software and open source, has a number of services it runs.

From the [Mandate Philosophy section](https://facil.qc.ca/association/mandat)[^gtranslate]: 

[^gtranslate]: Translated from the original French into English by Google Translate

> FACIL's mandate is to promote, directly or indirectly, the adoption, use and democratization of free computing and underlying open standards within the population of Quebec and its various public institutions, as well as to businesses and organizations.
>
> The members of the association believe that the exercise of fundamental freedoms as described and promoted by the various groupings of the international free software movement, of which the Free Software Foundation and the Open Source Initiative belong, foundations, companies and individuals from all walks of life, is beneficial and that its advantages are technical and economic, but above all ethical and political.
>
> The association is also concerned with other free resources, such as free documents. These resources include in particular, but not exclusively, specifications for software or exchange protocols between hardware or software, implementation documents, user manuals and educational resources.
>
> More generally, the association strives to promote and disseminate a "software culture" based on fundamental concepts such as the accessibility of specifications and source codes, the standardization of interfaces and data representations, the quality of implementations ( portability, modularity, compatibility, stability, robustness, openness, ...), cooperative development and mutual assistance.
