Social.coop is a cooperative corner of the Fediverse.

We primarily operate a Mastodon server. Our members fund our operations and decide how to set our community policies, steward our data, and manage our shared technologies. Members also provide the labor to run Social.coop at all levels.

If you are interested in joining Social.coop, please refer to our [registration form](https://join.social.coop/registration-form.html).

Social.coop was founded in 2017 in the wake of the BuyTwitter campaign. Since then, we have worked toward the goal of placing ever more of our online social lives under good cooperative governance. To get a sense of how we operate, or to start your own fediverse cooperative, see our guide on [How to Make the Fediverse Your Own](https://wiki.social.coop/wiki/How_to_Make_the_Fediverse_Your_Own).
